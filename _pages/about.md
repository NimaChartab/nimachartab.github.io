<p style="text-align:justify;">

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="https://obs.carnegiescience.edu">Carnegie Observatories</a>. My research focuses primarily on analyzing comprehensive spectroscopic and photometric galaxy surveys, enhanced with advanced artificial intelligence techniques, to study the formation and evolution of galaxies across diverse cosmic environments. I use a variety of methodologies, including large-scale distribution of galaxies and Lyman-Alpha tomography, to detect clusters of galaxies and their progenitors, known as protoclusters. I study how these extreme environments influence the evolution of galaxies, including but not limited to their star formation and metal enrichment histories.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">

At Carnegie I work with <a href="https://sites.google.com/carnegiescience.edu/anewman">Dr. Drew Newman</a> on the Lyman-Alpha Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS), which provides the largest Mpc-resolution 3D map of matter distribution at z~2.5 by observing the Ly-alpha forest in the spectra of more than 3000 background Lyman-break galaxies. I utilize LATIS to study the emergence of environmental effects in galaxy evolution at cosmic noon.</p>

Before joining Carnegie, I was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, Irvine, where I worked with <a href="https://herschel.uci.edu/">Prof. Asantha Cooray</a> on various research topics. These included studying the gas-phase metallicity of ultraluminous infrared galaxies using Far-Infrared emission line diagnostics <a href="https://astronomycommunity.nature.com/posts/low-gas-phase-metallicities-of-ultraluminous-infrared-galaxies-are-a-result-of-dust-obscuration">click for more details</a> and contributing to the pre-launch studies focused on the galaxy formation objectives of the <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/spherex/">SPHEREx</a> and newly launched <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/euclid/">Euclid</a> missions. I am an active member of the <a href="https://www.euclid-ec.org/">Euclid consortium</a> and lead spectroscopy of high redshift protoclusters in the Euclid Deep Fields as a part of the <a href="https://project.ifa.hawaii.edu/h20/">Hawaii Two-0 survey</a>.</p>

I earned my Ph.D. in March 2021, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, from the University of California, Riverside, under the supervision of <a href="https://engineeringonline.ucr.edu/faculty/bahram-mobasher/">Prof. Bahram Mobasher</a>. During my Ph.D., I utilized the data from <a href="http://arcoiris.ucolick.org/candels/">CANDELS</a> and <a href="https://mosdef.astro.berkeley.edu/">MOSDEF</a> surveys to study the evolution of galaxies in different environments over cosmic time. Additionally, I developed methods employing state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning techniques to maximize the scientific impact of current and upcoming space and ground-based observatories.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">

I began my academic journey with a BSc in Electrical Engineering in 2014, followed by an MSc in Physics in 2016, both from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharif_University_of_Technology">Sharif University of Technology</a>. Even before setting foot in the university, my heart was captivated by the wonders of astronomy; a passion that led me to win a gold medal at the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_on_Astronomy_and_Astrophysics">(IOAA)</a> in October 2009.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">

I am deeply passionate about mentoring and teaching. In the past, I mentored many high school students for the international astronomy olympiad. Furthermore, I've advised several undergraduate and graduate students from diverse backgrounds, helping them through exciting astronomy projects.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">

In my free time, when I'm not immersed in the joys of research and coding, I enjoy cooking delicious dishes, traveling, relaxing on the beach, singing karaoke, and exploring new destinations. </p>
