<p style="text-align:justify;">

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at the [Carnegie Observatories](https://obs.carnegiescience.edu). My research focuses primarily on analyzing comprehensive spectroscopic and photometric galaxy surveys, enhanced with advanced artificial intelligence techniques, to study the formation and evolution of galaxies across diverse cosmic environments. I use a variety of methodologies, including large-scale distribution of galaxies and Lyman-Alpha tomography, to detect clusters of galaxies and their progenitors, known as protoclusters. I study how these extreme environments influence the evolution of galaxies, including but not limited to their star formation and metal enrichment histories.

At Carnegie I work with [Dr. Drew Newman](https://sites.google.com/carnegiescience.edu/anewman) on the Lyman-Alpha Tomography IMACS Survey (LATIS), which provides the largest Mpc-resolution 3D map of matter distribution at z~2.5 by observing the Ly-alpha forest in the spectra of over 3000 background Lyman-break galaxies. I utilize LATIS to study the emergence of environmental effects in galaxy evolution at cosmic noon.  

Before joining Carnegie, I was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, Irvine, where I worked with [Prof. Asantha Cooray](https://herschel.uci.edu/) on various research topics. These included studying the gas-phase metallicity of ultraluminous infrared galaxies using Far-Infrared emission line diagnostics ([click for more details](https://astronomycommunity.nature.com/posts/low-gas-phase-metallicities-of-ultraluminous-infrared-galaxies-are-a-result-of-dust-obscuration)) and contributing to the pre-launch studies focused on the galaxy formation objectives of the SPHEREx and newly launched Euclid missions. I am an active member of the [Euclid consortium](https://www.euclid-ec.org/) and lead spectroscopy of high redshift protoclusters in the Euclid Deep Fields as a part of the [Hawaii Two-0 survey](https://project.ifa.hawaii.edu/h20/).

I earned my Ph.D. in March 2021, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, from the University of California, Riverside, under the supervision of [Prof. Bahram Mobasher](https://engineeringonline.ucr.edu/faculty/bahram-mobasher/). During my Ph.D., I utilized the data from [CANDELS](http://arcoiris.ucolick.org/candels/) and [MOSDEF](https://mosdef.astro.berkeley.edu/) surveys to study the evolution of galaxies in different environments over cosmic time. Additionally, I developed methods employing state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning techniques to maximize the scientific impact of current and upcoming space and ground-based observatories.

I began my academic journey with a BSc in Electrical Engineering in 2014, followed by an MSc in Physics in 2016, both from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharif_University_of_Technology). Even before setting foot in the university, my heart was captivated by the wonders of astronomy; a passion that led me to win a gold medal at the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics ([IOAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympiad_on_Astronomy_and_Astrophysics)) in October 2009.

I am deeply passionate about mentoring and teaching. In the past, I mentored many high school students for the International Astronomy Olympiads. Furthermore, I've advised several undergraduate and graduate students from diverse backgrounds, helping them through exciting astronomy projects.

In my free time, when I'm not immersed in the joys of research and coding, I enjoy cooking delicious dishes, traveling, relaxing on the beach, singing karaoke, and exploring new destinations. </p>
